# High-Leverage AI Strategies for Small Organizations

## üéØ Vision: Maximum Impact with Minimal Resources

Small teams can catalyze massive change by focusing on convening, connecting, and coordinating rather than building everything themselves. Think of yourself as the "AI matchmaker" for India.

## üöÄ Core Principle: Be the Platform, Not the Product

Instead of building AI, help others build AI. Instead of training everyone, train the trainers. Instead of funding everything, connect funders with founders.
